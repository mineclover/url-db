# Advanced Dependency Services

## Status: Under Development

This directory contains advanced dependency management services that are currently **under development**.

### Current State
- ✅ Comprehensive enterprise-grade dependency algorithms implemented
- ✅ Tarjan's algorithm for circular dependency detection
- ✅ Impact analysis with scoring and recommendations
- ✅ Graph caching and performance optimization
- ❌ Interface mismatches with current repository layer
- ❌ Missing proper integration tests

### Services Included

**DependencyGraphService** (`dependency_graph.go`)
- Circular dependency detection using Tarjan's algorithm
- Graph traversal optimization with caching
- Dependency validation and cycle prevention
- Performance optimized for large networks (1000+ nodes)

**DependencyImpactAnalyzer** (`dependency_impact.go`)  
- Comprehensive impact analysis for dependency changes
- Delete/update/version change impact assessment
- Impact scoring (0-100) with recommendations
- Cascade effect analysis with depth tracking

### Required Integration Work

To enable these services:

1. **Create Missing Interfaces**:
   - `NodeDependencyRepository` interface
   - `DependencyRepository` interface  
   - Extend `NodeRepository` for context-aware operations

2. **Implement Repository Layer**:
   - Add methods for V2 dependency table operations
   - Implement caching repository methods
   - Add history and rules repository support

3. **Model Updates**:
   - Add missing model definitions for advanced features
   - Extend existing models with V2 dependency fields

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive test suites
   - Performance benchmarks for large networks
   - Edge case testing for circular dependencies

### Database Schema Support

The advanced services are designed to work with the enhanced dependency schema in `/schema.sql`:

- `dependency_types` - 8 built-in dependency types
- `node_dependencies_v2` - Enhanced dependency management  
- `dependency_history` - Change tracking
- `dependency_graph_cache` - Performance optimization
- `dependency_rules` - Validation rules
- `dependency_impact_analysis` - Analysis results

### Future Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Interface definitions and basic repository implementations
2. **Medium Priority**: Integration testing and performance validation  
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features like ML-based dependency optimization

### Usage Notes

These services are **not currently integrated** into the main application due to interface mismatches. They represent a complete enterprise-grade dependency management system ready for integration once the required interfaces are implemented.

The services follow all established patterns and conventions from the main codebase and are designed to be drop-in compatible once integration requirements are met.
